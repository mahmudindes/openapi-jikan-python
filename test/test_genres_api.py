    Jikan API

    [Jikan](https://jikan.moe) is an **Unofficial** MyAnimeList API. It scrapes the website to satisfy the need for a complete API - which MyAnimeList lacks.  # Information  ⚡ Jikan is powered by its awesome backers - 🙏 [Become a backer](https://www.patreon.com/jikan)  ## Rate Limiting  | Duration | Requests | |----|----| | Daily | **Unlimited** | | Per Minute | 60 requests | | Per Second | 3 requests |  Note: It's still possible to get rate limited from MyAnimeList.net instead.   ## JSON Notes - Any property (except arrays or objects) whose value does not exist or is undetermined, will be `null`. - Any array or object property whose value does not exist or is undetermined, will be empty. - Any `score` property whose value does not exist or is undetermined, will be `0`. - All dates and timestamps are returned in [ISO8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) format and in UTC timezone  ## Caching By **CACHING**, we refer to the data parsed from MyAnimeList which is stored temporarily on our servers to provide better API performance.  All requests are cached for **24 hours**.  The following response headers will detail cache information.  | Header | Remarks | | ---- | ---- | | `Expires` | Cache expiry date | | `Last-Modified` | Cache set date | | `X-Request-Fingerprint` | Unique request fingerprint (only for cachable requests, not queries) |   Note: `X-Request-Fingerprint` will only be available on single resource requests and their child endpoints. e.g `/anime/1`, `/anime/1/relations`. They won't be available on pages which perform queries, like /anime, or /top/anime, etc.  ## Allowed HTTP(s) requests  **Jikan REST API does not provide authenticated requests for MyAnimeList.** This means you can not use it to update your anime/manga list. Only GET requests are supported which return READ-ONLY data.  ## HTTP Responses  All error responses are accompanied by a JSON Error response.  | Exception | HTTP Status | Remarks | | ---- | ---- | ---- | | N/A | `200 - OK` | The request was successful | | N/A | `304 - Not Modified` | You have the latest data (Cache Validation response) | | `BadRequestException`,`ValidationException` | `400 - Bad Request` | You've made an invalid request. Recheck documentation | | `BadResponseException` | `404 - Not Found` | The resource was not found or MyAnimeList responded with a `404` | | `BadRequestException` | `405 - Method Not Allowed` | Requested Method is not supported for resource. Only `GET` requests are allowed | | `RateLimitException` | `429 - Too Many Request` | You are being rate limited by Jikan or MyAnimeList is rate-limiting our servers (specified in the error response) | | `UpstreamException`,`ParserException`,etc. | `500 - Internal Server Error` | Something didn't work. Try again later. If you see an error response with a `report_url` URL, please click on it to open an auto-generated GitHub issue | | `ServiceUnavailableException` | `503 - Service Unavailable` | In most cases this is intentionally done if the service is down for maintenance. |  ## JSON Error Response  ```json  {      \"status\": 500,      \"type\": \"InternalException\",      \"message\": \"Exception Message\",      \"error\": \"Exception Trace\",      \"report_url\": \"https://github.com...\"   } ```  | Property | Remarks | | ---- | ---- | | `status` | Returned HTTP Status Code | | `type` | Thrown Exception | | `message` | Human-readable error message | | `error` | Error response and trace from the API | | `report_url` | Clicking this would redirect you to a generated GitHub issue |   ## Cache Validation  - All requests return a `ETag` header which is an MD5 hash of the response - You can use this hash to verify if there's new or updated content by suppliying it as the value for the `If-None-Match` in your next request header - You will get a HTTP `304 - Not Modified` response if the content has not changed - If the content has changed, you'll get a HTTP `200 - OK` response with the updated JSON response  ![Cache Validation](https://i.imgur.com/925ozVn.png 'Cache Validation')  ## Disclaimer  - Jikan is not affiliated with MyAnimeList.net. - Jikan is a free, open-source API.
